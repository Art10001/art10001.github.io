Affirmations to heal a broken heart

I am ready to forgive myself or anyone who has caused me emotional pain.

I choose to let go of the past and open my heart for love again.

I believe everything happens for a reason, even though I may not know it in this moment.

I am excited to start a new page in my life.

I attract people who accept me and love me for who I am.

I allow love to guide all my relationships.

All things are unfolding as they are supposed to.

In my sadness I create space to heal myself.
