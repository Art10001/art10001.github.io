Affirmations to heal sadness & depression

I am letting go of all negative feelings.

I learn to love myself unconditionally, more and more every day.

How I feel matters, therefore I concentrate on aspects of life that make me feel good.

Life wants the best for me and I allow happy events to enter my world.

I am grateful for my negative emotions as they teach me valuable lessons.
