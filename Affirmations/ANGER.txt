Affirmations to heal anger & resentment

The past is over and it has no power over me now. I refuse to be a victim anymore. I claim my power.

I give myself the gift of freedom from the past and move with joy into the future.

As I forgive myself, it becomes easier to forgive others.

Everyone has something to teach me, I raise above the events and see the main picture.

I return the basics of life: forgiveness, courage, gratitude, love and humor.
