Affirmations to heal emotional abuse

What I went through does not define who I am.

I see every situation as an opportunity to heal and grow.

I am strong, independent and respect my boundaries.

I know when to say NO.

Nothing and no one can take away my power.

I forgive myself for holding a grudge for anyone who has wronged me and I free myself.

I move beyond forgiveness to understanding and I have compassion and kindness for all.
