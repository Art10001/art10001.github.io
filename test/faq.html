         <BR><BR>
         <b>What is the Intention Repeater?</b><BR>
         &emsp;It is a free, open-source program that repeats your intention in computer memory up to a million or more times per second.<BR>
         &emsp;It works with a Servitor (programmed intelligent energy, 20 years/2000+ hours in the making).<BR>
         &emsp;There is no sound or video, but it can "write" to a file with emotion energy.<BR>
         &emsp;It represents a quantum leap in being able to harness the power of the word/intention.<BR>
         <BR>
         <b>It gives me an error when running. Why?</b><BR>
         &emsp;The Intention Repeater requires Python v3.5.3+<BR>
         <BR>
         <b>Why does the Python version go next line, next line instead of staying on one line when running?</b><BR>
         &emsp;Make sure your Terminal/Command Prompt window is wide enough.<BR>
         <BR>
         <b>What is a powerful intent for charging images, videos, music, etc.?</b><BR>
         &emsp;[filename] is extremely pure and of the highest vibration and is blessed with and full of [list emotions] for the highest good of all.<BR>
         &emsp;Note: It helps if the file is in the same folder as the Python code, and also using the same uppercase and lowercase spelling.<BR>
         <BR>
         <b>Can I run multiple intentions?</b><BR>
         &emsp;Yes. You can put all your intentions into a single TXT file and run that filename as your intention. It will run all intentions in it.<BR>
         &emsp;Be sure to maintain capitalization and spelling. If using Python version, it is best to have the filename in the same folder as intention_repeater.py.<BR>
         <BR>
         <b>How long should I charge/bless an image, video, music or other file?</b><BR>
         &emsp;It depends on your development. Higher vibration people can do it faster. You may feel the energy shift from being empty at first<BR>
         &emsp;to getting heavy and dense, and then possibly thinning out and becoming your desired emotion. I usually go for an hour at least.<BR>
         <BR>
         <b>Can I charge/clear a crystal with it?</b><BR>
         &emsp;For sure. Use the same technique as charging an image above, but substitute the crystal in the place of the "filename".<BR>
         <BR>
         <b>What is a powerful statement for forgiveness?</b><BR>
         &emsp;I am extremely pure and of highest vibration and am fully and totally forgiven for ... for the highest good of all.<BR>
         &emsp;or<BR>
         &emsp;Everyone I ever hurt and family are extremely pure and of highest vibration and are blessed with and full of captivation,<BR>
         &emsp;inspiration, wonder, bliss, healing, love and forgiveness for the highest good of all.<BR>
         <BR>
         <b>What is a powerful statement for doing inner work?</b><BR>
         &emsp;I bring up what needs to be brought up to be dealt with and am extremely pure and of highest vibration and blessed with and<BR>
         &emsp;full of healing, clearing, balancing and releasing for the highest good of all.<BR>
         <BR>
         <b>What is a powerful statement for clearing my environment and myself?</b><BR>
         &emsp;My environment and myself are extremely pure and of highest vibration and blessed with and full of healing, clearing,<BR>
         &emsp;balancing and releasing for myself and everyone around me for the highest good of all.<BR>
         <BR>
         <b>How can I heal someone?</b><BR>
         &emsp;[Person needing healing] is extremely pure and of highest vibration and is blessed with and full of perfect health and joy for the highest good of all.<BR>
         <BR>
         <b>How can I use it for motivation?</b><BR>
         &emsp;I am extremely pure and of highest vibration and blessed with and full of motivation to [what you want to do] for the highest good of all.<BR>
         <BR>
         <b>What intensity should I use for the Python version?</b><BR>
         &emsp;7 runs a million repetitions per second which is good. 8 may run two million per second depending on your computer.<BR>
         <BR>
         <b>Where can I get Python 3?</b><BR>
         &emsp;Search Google, as each platform (MacOS/Windows/Linux) has its own version. The Python code will run on any platform.<BR>
         <BR>
         <b>How do I run the Python version?</b><BR>
         &emsp;Open a Terminal/Command prompt, navigate to the folder with your intention_repeater.py file, and type: <b>python3 intention_repeater.py</b><BR>
         <BR>
         <b>Where can I get the Code to run?</b><BR>
         &emsp;You can get it <a href='./Python/intention_repeater.py' target="_blank" style="color:#FFFFFF;">here.</a><BR>
         <BR>
         <b>Can I run it TOO much?</b><BR>
         &emsp;It's possible. If you get a headache or too much discomfort from the work then take some time off. It can be intense.<BR>
         <BR>
         <b>What if I don't feel it working?</b><BR>
         &emsp;Keep at it with the inner work and clearing statements. There's a lot of inner resistance/blockages to get through to begin to feel energy.<BR>
         &emsp;I recommend doing an hour a day at most when you're first starting.<BR>
         &emsp;But I do recommend doing the <a href='chakras.html'>Chakra Meditations</a> as they become available.<BR>
         &emsp;Remember that everyone perceives energy differently.<BR>
         <BR>
         <b>What's a good tutorial on how to use it?</b><BR>
