In researching the world wide web for spiritual energy work, I found that computers<BR>
can also work with energy. I found some software that programs water,<BR>
though it is very expensive ($2000+). I had the idea then that that software may work<BR>
by repeating an intention. It is sort of like saying a prayer over and over again.<BR>
<BR>
The software I found did not let you choose your own intention, but choose from<BR>
a set of predefined criteria. I wanted the flexibility to allow for any positive intention<BR>
and not just limit to programming water.<BR>
<BR>
I wanted to offer my program for free. It has helped many people already with<BR>
anything from pain to anxiety to nurturing, and even helping one person find a job.<BR>
It takes your intention and amplifies it. Of course there are no guarantees, though<BR>
many people have found this tool very useful in their daily lives.<BR>
<BR>
What it does is repeat your intention in computer memory 10,000X per second.<BR>
Since everything is connected, all are One, it can work. Since all is NOW,<BR>
it can affect the future and the past as well.<BR>
<BR>
I credit this insight to my spirit guide, Trevor. I had him drawn once, and this is how he<BR>
appears to me. He is always welcoming me, is often humorous, and is skilled in energy work.<BR>
I have called on him many times to help clear me. Now that he has given me this tool,<BR>
I share it with the world. May you find it as useful and beneficial in your healing journey.<BR>
<BR>

Ten years in the making, a child discovers his place in the Universe<BR>
through dreams and the guidance of a benevolent and mysterious teacher.<BR>
